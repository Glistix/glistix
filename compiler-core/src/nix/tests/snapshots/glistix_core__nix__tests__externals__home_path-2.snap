----- ERROR
error: Invalid Nix module

  │ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The function `home` has an external Nix implementation but the module path
`~` is not valid. Currently, it must be a relative path (`./here.nix` or
`../top.nix`) with a restricted set of ASCII characters. To import from
unsupported paths, re-export them in an auxiliary Nix file in your project
instead.
