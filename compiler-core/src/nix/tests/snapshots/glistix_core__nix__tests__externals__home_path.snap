  │ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The function `home_path` has an external Nix implementation but the module
path `~/a` is not valid. Currently, it must be a relative path
(`./here.nix` or `../top.nix`) with a restricted set of ASCII characters.
To import from unsupported paths, re-export them in an auxiliary Nix file
in your project instead.
