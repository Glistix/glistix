error: Invalid Nix module
  ┌─ /src/one/two.gleam:3:1

  │ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The function `abs_path` has an external Nix implementation but the module
path `/abs/path` is not valid. Currently, it must be a relative path (`./
here.nix` or `../top.nix`) with a restricted set of ASCII characters. To
import from unsupported paths, re-export them in an auxiliary Nix file in
your project instead.
