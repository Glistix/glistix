error: Invalid Nix module

  │ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The function `one` has an external Nix implementation but the module path
`` is not valid. Currently, it must always be either an absolute path (`/
leading/slash.nix`) or a relative path (`./here.nix` or `../top.nix`) with
a restricted set of ASCII characters. To import from other paths, re-export
in an auxiliary Nix file instead.
