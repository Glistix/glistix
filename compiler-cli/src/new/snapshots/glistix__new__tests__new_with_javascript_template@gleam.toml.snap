# The [glistix.preview] namespace contains useful settings which will be needed
# during Glistix beta. In the future, we hope these won't be necessary anymore.
# None of the settings below are recognized by the official Gleam compiler.

# The section below allows replacing transitive dependencies with other packages,
# such as forks providing support for the Nix target. For example, `gleam_stdlib`
# does not support the Nix target, so we replace it with the `glistix_stdlib` fork.
# Replacing Hex packages with local packages is also supported (and Git packages
# in a future Glistix version).
#
# Specifying a version (or local path) is always required.
#
# NOTE: This section is ignored when publishing to Hex. It is only read on top-level
# Glistix projects. However, it can still be useful on packages to allow running unit
# tests, so you can keep this here regardless. Just keep this in mind if a user
# complains about a missing dependency: they are responsible for patching.

# Replaces 'gleam_stdlib' with 'glistix_stdlib' on all transitive dependencies.
