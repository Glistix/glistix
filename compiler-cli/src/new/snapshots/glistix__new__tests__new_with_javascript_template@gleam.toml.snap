# The [glistix.preview] namespace contains useful settings which will be needed
# during Glistix beta. In the future, we hope these won't be necessary anymore.

# The section below allows you to replace dependencies with alternative packages,
# such as forks providing support for the Nix target. For example, `gleam_stdlib`
# does not support the Nix target by default, so we replace it with the `glistix_stdlib`
# fork. You can also specify local dependencies here.
[glistix.preview.patch]
# Replace 'gleam_stdlib' with 'glistix_stdlib' for this package and all transitive dependencies.
# This is needed so stdlib will work on the Nix target.

# If you're patching a package using a local dependency/Git submodule and you

# The section below allows publishing your package to Hex despite having
# local dependencies, by declaring that you depend on another Hex package
# instead.
# This could be needed to be able to patch some package locally for Nix
# compatibility during development and at the same time publish to Hex without the
# patch.
# The section below should only be used for this purpose. Please do not abuse
# this feature, as it is mostly a temporary workaround while Gleam doesn't have
# its own dependency patching system.
